## Hotkeys

- `F7` will toggle the gearset variant, switching between `Haste`, `Balanced`, `Accuracy`, and `Evasion` as needed
- `F9` toggles `Treasure Hunter`

## Gathering
`/gather <command>` will enable that gathering mode, equipping the set that matches the name.
Current modes:
- 'Fish',
- 'Legendary',
- 'ItemFishing',
- 'Digging',
- 'Logging',
- 'Harvesting',

*Ensure you have equipment sets in the common/include.lua that match, such as `GatheringItemFishing`*
